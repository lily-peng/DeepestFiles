DeepestFiles
==============

A simple command-line application in Python that searches through a given directory for your deepest, most nested files.

* Ver 0.6 (2/12/2015): Added features
  * Added compatibility with Python 2.x and 3.x
  * User can input the types of files returned as well as how many maximum results
  * No longer returns empty results if user-inputted max results is greater than number of results found
* Ver 0.5 (2/6/2015): Prints the following: the top 5 deepest nested folders in the directory, the files within each, the number of subfolders traversed for each result, and the time elapsed for the application to run.
